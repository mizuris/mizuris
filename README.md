👋 Hi, I’m Peter!

I'm currently learning JavaScript with React. I take part in courses and I am studying on front-end related collage.
I work as graphic designer, and I've started creating websites for clients, getting my first real experiance!
It's been over a year since i started my first HTML & CSS course. My curiosity and willingness to learn made me understand these technologies:

- HTML5
- CSS3
- SASS/SCSS
- Bootstrap
- Material UI
- JavaScript 💞️
- React 💞️
- Redux
- Angular (basics)
- TypeScript

I wish to expand my stack diving deeper into mentioned technolgies 💞️
